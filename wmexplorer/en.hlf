    #Unicode file name support#
    Plugin supports Unicode file names inside its panel.
In case file name cannot be converted into OEM code page
without losing information special encoding is applied.
Every unconvertable character is encoded in the following way:
(asterisk) (character code), *AB for example. This encoding
is used for display only, original file name is left unchanged.
Looks ugly but better than nothing.
    Also when copying files from disk plugin tries to
find out correct Unicode file name using its short name.', `m4_dnl')

    #Special keys#
    These key combinations are destined for functions that cannot be
invoked from Far user interface. They can be changed by means of
plugin registry settings. For example, create string parameter
named key_execute and set its value to CtrlAltS.
    #key_execute Ctrl+Alt+S# - execute programm (selected file) on device.
    #key_hide_rom_files Ctrl+Alt+I# - show / hide files in ROM.

    #Advanced settings#
    #copy_buf_size# - DWORD, specifies internal buffer size
used during copy/move operations. If not set (default)
plugin will calculate buffer size automatically so that
it contains 0.5 seconds of data. This allows for acceptable
Esc key (cancel operation) reaction time. In case you don't
care about Esc reaction time you can specify larger buffer
size and thus improve copy speed of large files a little bit.

$ #Plugin Configuration#

    #Device access method#

    Select RAPI in case you have Windows Vista and experience problems
with WMDC not being able to detect device connection/disconnection event
after plugin is loaded. Select RAPI2 in any other case. Note that 
you need to restart FAR for this setting to take effect.

    Most significant differences between RAPI2 and RAPI:
    - multiple applications can transfer data at the same time
    - multiple devices can be connected at the same time
    - ability to query information about connected devices

    #Do not show own copy dialog#

    Plugin will not display its own parameters dialog when
copying files from disk. This way one can avoid showing
two dialogs (Far copy dialog first, plugin dialog second).

@copy.files.dlg
$^#<(NAME)> <(VER_MAJOR)>.<(VER_MINOR)>.<(VER_PATCH)>#
$ #File Copy Dialog#

    #Copy files to:#

    Specify destination path for copy operation in this field.
By default it is a current path on inactive panel when F5 key is used and 
current object name when Shift+F5 is used.
    Destination path will be created if it does not exist already.
In this case, when single object is copied, last path component will
be used as new object name (object will be renamed when moving files).
    Relative paths (which does not start with c:\) are always treated
as relative to current plugin directory. Thus it is possible to copy,
move and rename files directly on device without transferring
information to host PC. Specify relative path or device absolute path
(started with backslash e.g. '\Storage Card') when copying files
from plugin panel to do this. Shift+F5 and Shift+F6 are convenient shortcuts.

    #Ignore errors#

    When enabled copy procedure won't stop on error and will continue
to execute until all objects are processed. Errors counter is shown on
progress bar and copy statistics dialog which is shown when copy is complete.
    When option is off copy procedure will stop on first error and display
error message box.

    #When destination file exists:#

    What to do when destination file exists: skip it,
automatically overwrite or ask user every time.

    #Move files#

    This option will move or rename files instead of copying. 
It will be activated automatically when F6 or Shift+F6 is used.

    #Show statistics after file operation:#

    Controls when copy statistics dialog is shown: always, never or
only when errors are encountered (when #Ignore errors# is enabled)

    #Copy files open for writing#

    Allows to copy files open by other applications for writing.
Take care when using this option because file could be in process
of modification. Default value is taken from Far system settings.
